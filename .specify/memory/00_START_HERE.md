## 💡 Why This Matters

The constitution is **more than documentation**. It's:

1. **A shared vision** – Everyone knows the direction
2. **A decision framework** – When uncertain, consult it
3. **A quality gate** – PR reviews check against it
4. **A learning tool** – New members onboard faster
5. **A living document** – Evolves as needs change

It transforms your codebase from "inconsistent" to "professional" and your team from "figuring it out" to "executing with confidence."

---

└─ loading.tsx files: 0

PERFORMANCE
├─ Page load time: ↓ (cache benefits)
├─ Time to interactive: ↓ (streaming)
├─ Cache hit rate: ↑
├─ Database hits: ↓
